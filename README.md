# Online-news-popularity-prediction

This is a project of online news popularity prediction. The dataset used is much smaller than the original dataset. Therefore, the result might be a little bit different from the results generated from original dataset. 

I use Jupyter Notebook to generate the results, so the results are stored in ipynb file. 

There are totally 8 classifiers used in this project, including SVM, perceptron, RF, Decision Tree, logistics regression etc.
For more details, please take a look at the report.
